# Job Board Public

This is a work in progress, my intention is one day to have a full
MVD JS Meetup Group webpage and to have also a jobs section powered by this SPA.

I'm doing this work mainly to learn so you are free to use this code as you
please without letting me know or anything.

## What's inside

Inside this project you will find a Gulpfile file to pre process styles, turn on
a dev server and to browserify the js sources.

The app itself is a single Knockout ViewModel with some helpers I developed to
easily support routing.
